Objective: Implement a computer vision system to automate defect detection in casting, aiming for 
enhanced efficiency and accuracy while minimizing rejections and financial losses. 
• Tasks and Algorithms: Managed data collection, pre-processing, and augmentation for robustness. 
Developed a CNN architecture with advanced techniques like hyper parameter optimization and transfer 
learning for precise defect classification.
• Results: Achieved 98% accuracy with the CNN model, automating visual inspection to reduce time and 
resources. Ensured consistent results, mitigated risks of rejections, and enhanced operational efficiency 
and customer satisfaction.
